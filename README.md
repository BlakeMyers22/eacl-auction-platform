https://blakemyers22.github.io/eacl-auction-platform/

Current Functionality:
1.	Displays basic auction information for a property.
2.	Shows seller and highest bidder addresses (anonymized).
3.	Displays starting price and current highest bid.
4.	Shows the auction end time.
5.	Provides a form to place a bid.
   
How to Use and Present to an Investor:
1.	Introduction: "This is a prototype for the EACL Auction Platform, a blockchain-based real estate auction system. It demonstrates the core functionality of how users will interact with property auctions."
   
2.	Walk through the display: 
o	Point out the property ID, explaining that each property will have a unique identifier.
o	Highlight the seller and bidder addresses, emphasizing the transparency and anonymity blockchain provides.
o	Explain the starting price and highest bid, showing how the market determines property value.
o	Note the end time, describing how this creates urgency and fair competition.

3.	Demonstrate the bidding process: 
o	Enter a bid amount higher than the current highest bid.
o	Submit the bid and show the alert message.
o	Explain that in the full version, this would interact with a smart contract on the blockchain.

4.	Highlight potential features: 
o	"While this is a basic prototype, the full platform will include..."

Features to Highlight (existing and potential):
1.	Decentralized Auctions: Explain how blockchain ensures transparency and prevents fraud.
2.	Smart Contract Integration: Mention that bids and transactions will be automatically managed by smart contracts.
3.	Token-Based System: Describe how the EACL token will be used for bidding and transactions.
4.	Real-Time Updates: In the full version, bid updates will be real-time, creating an exciting auction environment.
5.	Property Details: Mention that each listing will include comprehensive property information, images, and documents.
6.	User Profiles: Explain how users will have secure profiles to track their bids, properties, and transaction history.
7.	Escrow Service: Highlight the built-in escrow system for secure transactions.
8.	Integration with Legal Services: Mention plans to integrate with legal services for seamless property transfers.
9.	Analytics Dashboard: Describe a future feature for users to track market trends and their investment performance.
10.	Mobile App: Discuss plans for a mobile app to allow bidding on-the-go.
    
How It Works (for the investor):
1.	Property Listing: "Sellers will list their properties with details and a starting price."
2.	Bidding Process: "Potential buyers place bids using EACL tokens, with a minimum increment."
3.	Smart Contract Execution: "When the auction ends, the smart contract automatically determines the winner and initiates the transaction process."
4.	Escrow and Transfer: "Funds are held in escrow while legal checks are performed, then automatically released upon successful transfer."
5.	Transaction Fees: "The platform generates revenue through listing fees and a small percentage of each successful sale."

Closing Statement: "This prototype demonstrates the core concept of our platform. With full development, EACL will revolutionize real estate auctions by providing a transparent, efficient, and global marketplace for property transactions."

Remember that this is a prototype, and the full version will have more features, better design, and full blockchain integration.
